##

project consists of five different classes and is a console-based application. When
the system starts the user is prompted with user id and user pin. On entering the
details successfully, then ATM functionalities are unlocked. The project allows to
perform **following operations**:
1. Transactions History
2. Withdraw
3. Deposit
4. Transfer
5. Quit
6. Add a new account.
